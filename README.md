# py_acosso
A python repo that reproduces the R library 'COSSO'. A few improvements added:  
- Improved efficiency, which allows the code to run faster
- Improved hyper-parameter optimization, better solutions can be found, with better generalization properties
- Gaussian kernels included; Users can combine various reproducing kernels in the Gram matrix
