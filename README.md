# py_acosso
A python repo with code that reproduces the R library 'COSSO'. I've added 2nd and 3rd order interactions, as I've seen that the normal COSSO struggles to solve highly non-linear functions. Happy to receive suggestions on how I can make this code run faster, as it's quite slow for anything above 200 knots.
